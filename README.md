# Rethinkify

[![Build](https://github.com/ZacWalk/rethinkify-app/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ZacWalk/rethinkify-app/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A lightweight Windows text editor for working across a folder full of notes, logs and data files. Point it at a folder, search everything in it, and read or edit whatever comes back.

Written in C++ and rendered with plain GDI. The only dependency is [platform-h](https://github.com/ZacWalk/platform-h), the Win32 abstraction it shares with its sibling apps — nothing third-party. It starts instantly and typically uses a few megabytes of memory.

Still a work in progress. (for about 10 years)

## Features

- **Folder browser** — navigate a root folder; create, rename and delete files inline
- **Multi-file search** — live search across the folder, grouped by file with highlighted matches (`Ctrl+Shift+F`)
- **Four document views** — text, Markdown, CSV table and hex, chosen automatically and remembered per file
- **Syntax highlighting** — C++, Rust, Python, PowerShell and Markdown
- **C/C++ navigation** — go to definition (`F12`), switch header/source (`Ctrl+F12`), and navigation history (`Alt+Left` / `Alt+Right`), using a lightweight lexical index rather than a compiler
- **Editing** — unlimited undo, word wrap, indent/unindent, spell check
- **Coding agent** — talk to GitHub Copilot about the open folder (`Ctrl+Shift+A`, or `F4` to type)
- **Utilities** — JSON reformat (`Ctrl+R`), sort and de-duplicate lines, evaluate a selected expression (`Ctrl+E`)
- **Session memory** — restores the recent root folders and the last document open in each

Open documents are never closed behind your back: unsaved files stay in memory with their full undo history and are shown in red. You are prompted to save only when changing folder or exiting.

## Agent

The right-hand panel hosts a coding agent that can read and change the folder you have open. It needs [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli) installed and signed in; Rethinkify runs it as a child process and speaks the Agent Client Protocol to it.

The conversation is not hidden in the application — it is `session.md` in the folder you opened. Open it, edit it, delete a turn that went wrong, and the agent carries on from what the file says. It survives restarts, one conversation per folder.

Nothing runs without your say-so: every tool the agent proposes is shown with its exact command and numbered choices, and waits. `/yolo` turns that off for a session if you want it to get on with things, and is never restored automatically.

| | |
|---|---|
| `/help`, `/h` | What you can type |
| `/clear`, `/c` | Empty the conversation (`Ctrl+Z` brings it back) |
| `/stop`, `/s` | Stop the current turn |
| `/models`, `/m` | List models, or pick one |
| `/yolo` | Run tools without asking |

## Building

Requires Windows x64 and Visual Studio with the Desktop C++ workload. The
vendored [dd](https://github.com/ZacWalk/dd) runtime locates Visual Studio and
uses the CMake and Ninja that ship with it.

```powershell
.\dd.ps1 build        # both configurations
.\dd.ps1 test         # build and run the suite
.\dd.ps1 launch       # build, then start a persistent app
```

Output is `exe\rethinkify-64.exe`, or `rethinkify-64d.exe` for Debug. Neither
`run` nor `launch` closes an already-running copy, so close the app before
rebuilding its executable.

The platform layer comes from [platform-h](https://github.com/ZacWalk/platform-h)
via `FetchContent`; a sibling `../platform-h` checkout is used automatically
when present.
