# Rethinkify — Design

How Rethinkify is put together and why. For what it does and how to build it, see [README.md](../README.md). For working-agreements when changing the code, see [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

## Goals

1. **Fast and small.** No dependencies beyond the Win32 API and the shared platform layer. Files load once into a single immutable buffer; lines are slices until edited. Typical memory use is a few megabytes.
2. **One obvious mental model.** Two panes. The left pane lists things to open; the right pane shows the current document. Everything else is a mode of one of those two.
3. **Nothing hidden.** No background writes, no autosave, no telemetry. Configuration is written at shutdown.

## Layers

```
platform-h (separate repo)      OS abstraction: windows, input, drawing, files, config, clipboard, spell check, async, child processes
        ↑
app.cpp / app_state.h           Application: window layout, document index, search, commands, session
        ↑
view_*.h                        Panes: document views, list panels and the agent pane
document.* / document_syntax.*  Text model: lines, selection, undo, highlighting
acp.* / agent_*.*               Agent: protocol, transcript file, host
json.* / util.* / calc.h        Leaf utilities
```

The platform layer lives in the shared [platform-h](https://github.com/ZacWalk/platform-h) repository, pulled in by CMake and used by the other apps in the workspace. `platform.h` declares OS-free types (`window_frame`, `frame_reactor`, `draw_context`, `file_path`, …); `platform_win.cpp` is the only implementation. Nothing in this repo includes `windows.h`, and no OS parameter reaches it raw: the messages that carry data (`timer`, `dpi_changed`, `drop_files`) arrive as a decoded `pf::message_params`.

### Build tooling

The unmodified [dd v0.2.0](https://github.com/ZacWalk/dd/releases/tag/v0.2.0)
runtime is vendored in `dd.ps1` and `.dd/`, with its upstream revision and file
hashes recorded in `docs/dd-upstream.json`. It is developer tooling, not an
application dependency. `dd.psd1` maps the Debug/Release presets and executable
paths; CMake continues to own the build graph and platform-h acquisition. CTest
runs the executable's `/test` entry point, with the `unit` label letting CI skip
dd's separate desktop smoke tests.

### Threading

One UI thread and one worker thread. `pf::run_async` queues work onto the worker; `pf::run_ui` marshals results back, waking the message loop through `MsgWaitForMultipleObjects`. Only two operations run off the UI thread — **folder indexing** and **search** — and both take a snapshot of what they need on the UI thread first. The worker never dereferences a live `index_item` or `document`.

A hosted agent adds two more threads, one per pipe, because a blocking `ReadFile` cannot share the single worker with indexing and search. They own nothing but a byte buffer: each splits its stream into lines and hands every complete line to the UI thread through `pf::run_ui`, guarded by a shared cancelled flag so no callback can arrive after the process object is gone.

Opening a document is also asynchronous, so anything that depends on the loaded text (such as selecting a search match) must be passed to `load_doc` as a completion callback. Tests use `deferred_scheduler`, which queues tasks and drains them on `pump()`, so they exercise the production ordering rather than completing inline.

### Invalidation

Views never repaint directly. They set bits in an atomic mask (`invalid::doc_layout`, `doc_caret`, `doc_scrollbar`, `files_layout`, `files_populate`, `search_layout`, `search_populate`, `agent_layout`, `index`, `windows`, `app_title`). The message loop calls `app_idle()` once per pump, which coalesces layout, scrollbar recalculation, caret update, list population and repaint into one pass.

The document model distinguishes three notifications, and the difference is what keeps typing cheap:

- `invalidate_lines(start, end)` — **repaint only**. Raised by selection and caret movement. It touches no layout and no highlighting.
- `lines_changed(start, end)` — **the text changed**. Marks those lines dirty for word wrap, lowers the syntax-highlight cookie watermark, and raises `doc_layout`.
- `line_count_changed(at, delta)` — **lines were inserted after `at` or erased from `at + 1`**. The view splices its per-line arrays (wrap offsets, row prefix sum, highlight cookies) by `delta` instead of rebuilding them, so pressing Enter costs the same in a 50,000-line file as in a 5-line one.

`doc_view::layout()` then re-wraps only the dirty lines and patches the row prefix sum by the delta. A full re-wrap happens only when the document is replaced, the width changes, word wrap is toggled, or a splice cannot patch what it finds — either the cached arrays no longer describe the document, or an earlier edit left a dirty line range in the old numbering.

## Window layout

```
┌───────────────┬─┬───────────────────────────────┬─┬─────────────────┐
│ left pane     │ │ document pane                 │ │ agent pane      │
│ files  OR     │▓│ text / markdown / csv / hex   │▓│ session.md      │
│ search        │ │                               │ ├─────────────────┤
│               │ │                               │ │ input           │
└───────────────┴─┴───────────────────────────────┴─┴─────────────────┘
                 └ splitter (5px, DPI-scaled, ratio 0.05–0.95)
```

The agent pane is hidden by default and toggled with `Ctrl+Shift+A`. Its splitter divides only what is left of the document pane, so the two can never cross; with no room left it collapses against the right edge rather than leaving the window.

`view_mode` is the cross product of `view_content` (`edit_text`, `markdown`, `csv`, `hex`) and search-panel on/off. `app_state::set_mode` swaps the document pane's reactor for the matching view class and points the left pane at either the file list or the search panel.

## Document model

- A file is loaded once into an immutable `file_buffer` (capped at **2 MB**; larger files are truncated at a codepoint boundary and forced read-only). A truncated document refuses to save, so the rest of the file cannot be lost.
- `document` is a `std::vector<document_line>`. A line is either an owned `std::string` or a `(buffer, offset, length)` slice; slices cost 32 bytes and transcode UTF‑16 on render. Byte length is cached, so `size()` is O(1).
- All coordinates (`text_location.x`) are **UTF‑8 byte offsets**, not columns or codepoints. Display columns are derived through a per-line expanded-length cache that accounts for tabs.
- **Undo** is a linear `vector<undo_item>` with a redo cursor. Each item is an ordered list of insert/erase steps, replayed forward to redo and in reverse to undo. `undo_group` is an RAII scope that commits on destruction. Dirty state is `_undo_pos != _saved_undo_pos`, so undoing back to the last save marks the document clean.
- **Save** writes to a temp file and moves it into place. The detected encoding is preserved: a UTF‑16 file is written back as UTF‑16, and a BOM-less file never gains a BOM. Saving re-checks the on-disk timestamp and prompts if the file changed underneath.
- Documents live in the folder index. Switching files never prompts to save; unsaved documents stay in memory with their undo history and are shown in red. You are prompted only when changing the root folder or exiting. Unmodified documents past the **24** most recently opened are dropped and reloaded on demand — modified work and generated documents are never dropped.

### Syntax highlighting

Per-line, stateless except for a 32-bit carry cookie (in-comment / in-string flags) threaded from the previous line. Each highlighter resets and fills a sorted array of `text_block{char_pos, style}`. The view caches cookies with a "valid to line N" watermark and rescans backwards at most 1000 lines, so an edit invalidates highlighting in O(1). Languages: C++, Rust, Python, PowerShell, Markdown, hex, plain text.

The four C-like languages share one scanner driven by a `syntax_rules` table — line and block comment tokens, escape character, whether `#` starts a directive, and whether `-` may appear in an identifier. Adding a language of that shape is one table entry plus a keyword set.

## View hierarchy

```
pf::frame_reactor
└── view_base                  scroll offset and content extent, both in pixels
    ├── text_view              font metrics, screen lines, message bar, clipboard, zoom, Escape
    │   └── doc_view           document, caret, selection, word wrap, hit-testing, painting
    │       ├── edit_doc_view          writable: the document pane and the agent prompt
    │       │   └── agent_input_view    the prompt, grown to fit up to five rows
    │       └── read_only_doc_view     no caret, no h-scroll, word wrap locked, keys scroll
    │           ├── markdown_doc_view
    │           ├── csv_doc_view
    │           ├── hex_doc_view
    │           └── agent_view             the session.md transcript
    └── list_view              rows, selection, hover, keyboard navigation, row copy
        ├── file_list_view     folder tree, inline rename, drag-drop
        └── search_list_view   search box, grouped results
```

Everything above `agent_view` and the two list panels is `pf::ui`, named locally by
a one-line header. A list row is a `pf::ui::list_item`; the panels hang their own
object off its `data` — an `index_item` for the folder browser, a search hit for the
search panel — and the shared list never looks inside it.

The split between `edit_doc_view` and `read_only_doc_view` is what makes the read-only panes predictable: they have no caret, cannot scroll horizontally, ignore Alt+Z, ignore Shift, and their arrow keys scroll rather than move an invisible cursor. Hex does not drag-select, because its layout is not the document's — `Ctrl+A` still selects everything so the text can be copied. Markdown hit-tests the layout it drew and selects like the editor; CSV selects whole records, since a cell is drawn padded into its column. Escape always returns them to the text editor.

## Panes and what each one does

| Pane | Purpose | Opens with | Leaves with |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Folder browser** | Navigate the root folder; create, rename and delete files | default | — |
| **Search** | Live text search across the root folder | `Ctrl+Shift+F` | `Escape` |
| **Text editor** | The only place text can be changed | default | — |
| **Markdown preview** | Read rendered `.md` | `Ctrl+M`, auto for `.md`/`.markdown` | `Escape` |
| **CSV table** | Read `.csv` as an aligned table | auto for `.csv` | `Escape` |
| **Hex** | Read binary files | auto for binary content | `Escape` |
| **Agent** | Talk to a coding agent about the open folder | `Ctrl+Shift+A`, `F4` | `Escape` returns focus |

Each document remembers its own content view, so switching away and back restores what you were looking at.

### Folder browser

Click or arrow-key to preview a file (focus stays in the list); `Enter` opens it and moves focus to the editor. Clicking a folder expands or collapses it. Modified files are red; long names are ellipsized. Right-click gives New File, New Folder, Copy Path, Rename (`F2`) and Delete (Recycle Bin, with confirmation). New items are named `new-file.md` / `new-folder`, suffixed `-2`, `-3`, … until unique. Names are validated against path separators, `.`/`..`, trailing dots and reserved device names. Files can be dropped onto the panel to copy them in.

### Folder index

Indexing is recursive and runs off the UI thread. `.git` is always skipped, and every `.gitignore` encountered on the way down is applied to the subtree below it — so build output stays out of the browser, out of search and out of memory. The matcher (`gitignore.h`) covers comments, `!` negation, directory-only `dir/`, anchored patterns and the `*`, `**` and `?` wildcards; character classes are not matched, so an unrecognised pattern leaves the file visible rather than hiding it silently.

### Search

Typing runs a live search, debounced by 150 ms; a newer query cancels the one in flight. Because a longer query can only match where a shorter one already did, a query that extends the previous one rescans only the files that previously matched — so each extra keystroke costs a handful of files rather than the whole folder. Any edit or reindex bumps a content generation that disables this narrowing until the next full scan.

Results are grouped under a collapsible per-file header showing the relative path and match count. Selecting a match opens the file and selects the match — the document may still be loading, so the selection is applied from the load continuation rather than immediately. Focus stays in the panel until `Enter`. `F8` / `Shift+F8` jump between matches. Limits: **5,000 results** (the count reads "limit reached" when hit), files over **10 MB** skipped, binary files skipped (extension list plus a content sniff of the first block, taken from the same read used to scan the file). A result keeps at most **400 bytes** of context around its match, so a minified file with megabyte-long lines cannot blow up either memory or paint time.

### Text editor

Character input with unlimited per-document undo. Word wrap (`Alt+Z`) is application state, applied to every editable view and persisted. Tab/Shift+Tab indent and unindent; `Ctrl+R` reformats JSON; Edit ▸ Sort & Remove Duplicates sorts case-sensitively and de-duplicates; `Ctrl+E` replaces a selected arithmetic expression with its value. Double-click selects a word, the left margin selects lines, `Ctrl+click` selects a word, `Ctrl+click` in the margin selects everything. Dragging a selection moves it, or copies it when `Ctrl` is held; `Escape` cancels the drag. The active row carries a subtle highlight band while the editor has focus.

### Markdown preview

Headings (H1–H3, size-scaled), bold and italic (rendered as colour, not weight), inline and fenced code, links, ordered and unordered lists with hanging indents, and tables with wrapped cells, width-capped columns and numeric right-alignment.

The view is `pf::ui::markdown_view`, shared with the other applications. It draws the **source** — markers and all — so what is selected is what is in the file, and it parses that source with `pf::ui::md` so it knows what each line means. Selection works as it does in the editor, including drag, double-click and the margin; a table row selects whole, because its cells are drawn padded into their columns. Clicking a link reports its target to the application, which decides what a target means; this app does not yet act on one.

### CSV table

RFC 4180 parsing including quoted fields. Aligned pipe-delimited columns, a brighter header row followed by a separator, width-capped columns with wrapped cell text, and numeric right-alignment. Dragging selects whole records — a cell is drawn padded into its column, so there is no byte under the pointer to select — and copying gives the records as they are in the file.

### Hex

Offset (8 hex digits) | 16 bytes | ASCII.

## Agent

The agent pane hosts **GitHub Copilot CLI** as a child process (`copilot --acp --stdio`) and speaks the **Agent Client Protocol** to it — JSON-RPC 2.0 as newline-delimited JSON over the process's standard streams. The CLI owns authentication, model routing, MCP servers and the agent loop; Rethinkify is the client. `pf::find_executable` resolves `copilot` through PATHEXT only and never searches the current directory, so a file planted in the folder you opened cannot be launched in its place.

The process starts on the first message, not at startup, because it is by far the largest thing in the address space — a Node single-file binary that costs a few hundred megabytes, against about thirteen for the editor itself. The `initialize` reply names the protocol version the agent will speak; anything newer than this build understands is refused there rather than half-driven.

### The transcript is a file

The conversation is `session.md` in the root folder: a real file, one per folder, loaded when the folder opens and reloaded when it changes underneath. That single decision provides history across restarts, an editable record, undo of an agent turn, and markdown preview of the conversation — all from machinery that already existed.

The lines are authoritative and an `agent_entry` only describes a range of them, so serialising is byte-exact by construction. Parsing is total: anything unrecognised stays in the entry it appears in, so a hand-edited file can never fail to load. Only exact role headings (`## You`, `## Agent`, `## Session`, `## Thinking`, `## Error`) open an entry — otherwise the markdown headings an agent writes would split its own replies — and a body line that would look like one is escaped with a backslash. Options are markdown task-list items, so ticking one by hand does what clicking it does.

Streamed output patches only the lines it touched, so a token costs one line re-layout rather than a document rebuild. The file is written when the transcript settles, never per token. **This is the one deliberate exception to "no background writes"**: one write per turn, to a file you can see, caused by something you asked for. Older history rolls into `session-<stamp>.md` before the document size cap can be reached.

The transcript has its own `document_events` sink. Sharing `app_state` would route its edits to the document pane and corrupt that pane's word-wrap cache.

### The file is ours, the memory is the agent's

An ACP session lives in the agent process, so the transcript on disk and what the agent recalls are two different things. They part company whenever the process is new and the file is not: after a restart, after the agent dies, and after the folder changes — `cwd` is fixed when the session is created, so a new root folder has to mean a new session.

Rather than show a full conversation to an agent that remembers none of it, `agent_host` gives a new session what it missed. `transcript_digest` renders the file back to prose — the exchange only, never the session block, local notes or thinking — keeps the most recent **16 KB** because only the tail still bears on the next turn, and rides in front of the first prompt of that session as its own content block, labelled as history rather than as a request. Edits you made to the file by hand travel with it, which is what makes the transcript worth editing. A live session is never told twice.

`session/load` would be the protocol's own answer, and is deliberately not used: it replays the whole conversation back as `session/update` notifications, which this design would write into the file a second time. The digest costs one block and works against agents that never implement it.

Each prompt also carries what the editor can see and the agent cannot — the open file, whether it has unsaved changes, the caret line, and up to **4 KB** of the selection. `app_state::agent_context` gathers it on the UI thread through `agent_host::gather_context`, so "explain this" means something.

A turn is one prompt at a time. A message typed while the agent is working joins a queue and goes when the turn ends, and questions queue the same way: an agent that asks two things at once has both recorded, but only the one at the head is written to the file, so a typed number can only ever mean the question on screen. Anything still queued when the agent dies is reported as lost rather than sent to its replacement.

### The prompt is the editor again

The pane is two windows, not one: the transcript above, and below it `agent_input_view` — an `edit_doc_view` over a document of its own. Reusing the editor rather than growing a widget is what gives the prompt mouse and keyboard selection, cut/copy/paste, word wrap, spell check and undo without writing any of them twice. Editing commands ask what has focus, so `Ctrl+Z` in the prompt cannot reach the document pane. Like the transcript, it has its own `document_events` sink.

It grows to fit what you type, up to five rows, and scrolls past that. `layout_views` asks the view how tall it wants to be, so the height follows the wrapped row count and the agent font size. Typing at the transcript, which is read-only, hands the character to the prompt.

### Tools and files

Every tool call the agent proposes arrives as a permission request and is shown with numbered options; nothing runs until you answer by typing the number or clicking it, and the choice is ticked in the file so the record matches what was sent. `/m` reuses the same numbered-option mechanism for choosing a model, answering locally instead of replying to the agent. `/yolo` answers for you — it is recorded in the session block but **never resumed from a file**, so a session saved with it on comes back with it off and a note saying so.

Rethinkify advertises `fs/read_text_file` and `fs/write_text_file`, so an agent that honours them reads unsaved work from the open document and writes through `replace_text` inside an `undo_group`. Every path is refused unless it canonicalises to somewhere inside the open folder, which closes both `..` traversal and links.

### Commands

| | |
|---|---|
| `/help`, `/h` | Prompt help, generated from the same table that drives the parser |
| `/clear`, `/c` | Empty the transcript. An ordinary edit, so `Ctrl+Z` brings it back |
| `/stop`, `/s` | Stop the current turn |
| `/models`, `/m` | Offer the models the agent reported as numbered options, or set one by id |
| `/yolo` | Toggle running tools without asking |

Anything else beginning with `/` is forwarded when the agent advertised it, and reported locally when it did not.

## Project tools

The **Tools** menu runs the root folder's `dd.ps1` and, later, CMake and the compiler. Nothing here is a linked dependency — they are the user's own toolchain, started with `pf::spawn_child_process` as an argument array, never as an assembled shell string, and never with `-ExecutionPolicy`. See [cpp.md](cpp.md) for the whole plan.

The menu's contents come from the script rather than from a hard-coded list. When the index finishes, `discover_tools` asks PowerShell to parse `dd.ps1` with `Parser::ParseFile` and print the parameter AST as JSON — it *reads* the script, never runs it, so opening a folder can never execute anything. A first positional parameter's `ValidateSet` becomes the commands; any other parameter with a set becomes a submenu of choices. With no `dd.ps1` the menu says so and stays disabled.

The shared dd driver used to build this repository has no such parameter
block. Current discovery therefore falls back to **Run dd.ps1** (dd help);
use PowerShell or VS Code tasks to build this repository until the editor
supports the shared driver's manifest interface. Legacy script discovery
is unchanged.

`tools::runner` is the one execution path. A run produces a `tools::result` — command line, exit code, elapsed time, output with stderr identified per line, parsed diagnostics and failed targets. The generated `tool-output.md` document is one *rendering* of that value; the message bar and, later, the error list and MCP replies are others. Nothing exists only inside the document.

Only one tool runs at a time, but a second request is **queued rather than refused**, carrying the identity of whoever asked, so a build an agent starts while the user's build is running waits its turn instead of silently doing nothing. Output is bounded — the first and last few thousand lines, with a count of what was dropped. A dirty document prompts save / discard / cancel before anything runs, and `clean` confirms every time.

`tool_output.cpp` turns the merged stream into diagnostics: MSVC, clang, the linker, CMake's indented error blocks, Ninja progress and `FAILED:` targets, CTest failures and PowerShell error records. ANSI escapes are stripped first. A `note:` attaches to the diagnostic above it, as does the indented block under it — MSVC's `with [ _Ty=int ]` template context belongs to the note it follows, not to the file. A line that matches nothing is kept verbatim; nothing is ever dropped.

`F8` and `Shift+F8` step through the last run's diagnostics, wrapping in both directions, opening each file and putting the caret on the reported line and column. A diagnostic that names no line — a linker error naming an object file — reports in the message bar and moves nothing.

## C++ navigation

Rethinkify parses C++ itself. `cpp_lex` produces a token stream — raw strings, line splices, directive continuations and all — and `cpp_index` walks it at declaration level, **skipping function bodies wholesale**, which is what makes it fast and what keeps it out of the hardest parts of the language. A symbol is name, scope, file, offset, line, column and kind; names and scopes are interned, and symbols are keyed by file so one file can be reparsed and spliced back. The whole of `src/` indexes at around 80 MB/s.

The index is rebuilt on the worker thread after a folder refresh, from paths snapshotted on the UI thread. Source files are decoded to UTF-8, including UTF-16 input, so index positions match document byte coordinates. A generation check rejects results from an older refresh or root folder. Only the UI thread reads the published index; resident source documents override disk text when it is published and before a lookup, including unsaved edits and undo back to saved text.

`F12` resolves the name at the caret, ranks the candidates — definitions before declarations, the current file before others, a type before a variable — and jumps to the best. Names resolve *lexically*, so an overload set is a set: pressing `F12` again on the same name offers the next candidate, and the message bar says which one of how many. That is the picker, without a popup. `Ctrl+F12` switches between a header and its source, preferring the sibling in the same folder. `Alt+Left` and `Alt+Right` walk two stacks of visited locations.

Right-clicking C/C++ text focuses the editor and offers **Go to Definition** and
**Switch Header/Source** alongside the usual editing commands. Definition lookup
uses the clicked name even inside a selection; Copy keeps the original selection
until a navigation command is chosen. Keyboard-opened context menus use the caret.
These commands are available only in the focused C/C++ text view, including
read-only source, not in previews, the file list, or the agent prompt.

Candidate cycling retains the original file preference until the caret moves,
so jumping into another file cannot reorder the next result. Navigation messages
and selections are applied after asynchronous loading completes. Back/Forward
skip deleted entries, clamp obsolete positions to valid UTF-8 boundaries, and
reset when the root folder changes.

## Commands and keyboard

One `std::vector<command_def>` (`app_state::make_commands`) is the single source of truth for the menu bar, the enable/check state, the runtime accelerator table and the generated About document. Each entry owns its own lambda; adding a command is one table entry. Commands report through the message bar at the top of the document pane.

There is exactly one accelerator dispatcher: the Win32 accelerator table built from the menu, which routes to the command's lambda. Every binding lives in the table, including the secondary ones (`Ctrl+Ins`, `Shift+Ins`, `Shift+Del`, `Alt+Backspace`, `F3`), which are declared as a command's `accel_alt`. A view only handles keys the table does not claim — caret movement, `Backspace`, `Tab`. Commands are focus-aware rather than focus-routed — each one asks what has focus and acts, instead of re-dispatching a synthetic keystroke to another window.

Two rules cover every command:

- **Clipboard and delete** (`Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+X`, `Ctrl+V`, `Delete`, `Ctrl+A`) act on whatever has focus — the editor, the file list, or the search/rename edit box. An inline edit box wins for copy and cut only when it has a selection, so `Ctrl+C` in the search panel still copies the selected result's path.
- **Text-editing commands** (undo, redo, reformat, sort, calculate, spell check) require the text editor: they are disabled while an inline edit box has focus, while a read-only preview is showing, and on a read-only document. `document::replace_text` also refuses on a read-only document, so no path can bypass the check.
- **Save and Save As** are disabled on a read-only document, and `document::save_to_file` refuses one outright, so a truncated file can never be written back over the original.

`F5` refreshes the focused panel: the search when the search panel has focus, the folder index otherwise. `F8` / `Shift+F8` and `Alt+Z` are disabled outside the panes they apply to; `F8` navigates results and does not open the search panel, which is `Ctrl+Shift+F`.

### Text input

`WM_CHAR` delivers UTF-16 code units. The platform layer combines surrogate pairs and hands the application a `char32_t`, which the editor and every inline edit box encode to UTF-8 before inserting. Word navigation classifies any non-ASCII byte as a word byte, so a scan can never stop between the lead and continuation bytes of one codepoint.

## Spell check

Three modes — `auto_detect` (default; active for `.md` and `.txt`), `enabled`, `disabled` — persisted in config and toggled with `Ctrl+Shift+P`. Misspellings are underlined in the editor; right-click offers suggestions and *Add to Dictionary*. The platform checker is created lazily and spell check is silently inactive when none is available.

## Configuration

An INI beside the executable when that folder is writable, otherwise `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Rethinkify\rethinkify.ini`. Written at shutdown, so no command-line mode ever writes it.

| Section | Keys |
|---|---|
| `Window` | `Left`, `Top`, `Right`, `Bottom`, `Maximized` |
| `Font` | `TextSize`, `ListSize` (clamped 8–72) |
| `Splitter` | `PanelRatio` (clamped 0.05–0.95, default 0.2) |
| `Agent` | `Visible`, `SplitterRatio` (0.05–0.95), `FontSize` (8–72) |
| `View` | `WordWrap`, `SpellCheck` |
| `Recent` | `Folder`, `Document` |
| `RecentFolders` | `Folder1`–`Folder8`, `Document1`–`Document8` |

The agent's own settings — the model, and whether tools run without asking — live in `session.md` rather than here, so they travel with the conversation.

Restored paths are validated: UNC and non-existent roots are skipped. Passing a file on the command line skips session restore entirely.

## Command line

| | |
|---|---|
| `rethinkify-64d.exe /test` | Run the unit tests to stdout; exit 0 on success, 1 on any failure. No GUI. |
| `rethinkify-64d.exe /spell:<word>` | Print spell-checker diagnostics and suggestions. No GUI. |
| `rethinkify-64d.exe /acp[:<prompt>]` | Start the agent and run the protocol handshake, optionally sending one prompt. Tests the process and protocol layers. No GUI. |
| `rethinkify-64d.exe /agent:<prompt>` | Run one turn through the same host the panel uses, printing the transcript. Tests the whole agent path. No GUI. |
| `rethinkify-64d.exe <path>` | Open a file. Arguments starting with `/` or `-` are ignored; the last plain argument wins. |

Both `/x` and `--x` forms are accepted. Neither agent diagnostic ever approves a tool call, and `/agent:` refuses the file bridge outright, so nothing is written on their behalf.

## Known limitations

- Documents are capped at 2 MB; a larger file opens read-only showing the first 2 MB.
- CSV selects and copies whole records rather than individual cells, because a cell is drawn padded into its column; hex has no drag selection at all, though `Ctrl+A` copies it.
- A markdown table is drawn padded into its columns, so dragging over one selects whole source lines rather than individual cells.
- Case-insensitive search folds ASCII and Latin-1; other scripts compare case-sensitively.
- Saving a UTF-32 file writes UTF-8; UTF-8 and UTF-16 round-trip.
- The agent needs GitHub Copilot CLI installed and signed in, and it dominates memory use — the editor is around 13 MB, the agent a few hundred.
- Copilot CLI reads and writes files itself rather than calling the client's `fs/*` methods, so its edits do not currently pass through the document model's undo. The bridge is implemented for agents that do use it.
